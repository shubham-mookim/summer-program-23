SPORT NAME:
Cricket

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Creating data repositories for sports based on image/video data:
The lack of publicly available, curated datasets in multiple sports hinders progress in sports analytics research and development. A research area that could address this issue is the development of efficient and standardized methods for collecting and curating large volumes of sports data, with a focus on ensuring data quality, privacy, and security. Such methods could enable the creation of a centralized, open-access data repository that would facilitate algorithm development and validation, as well as the exploration of new research questions and approaches in sports analytics.
